# Call TADs, measure concordance, and compare gaps between TADs

### 1. Call TADs using TopDom

[TopDom](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/TopDom)

Call domains on .hic matrix (Knight-Ruiz normalization) for all chromosomes at give resolution:

```
bash hic2topdom.sh sample1 /path/to/sample1.hic sample2 /path/to/sample2.hic [resolution in bp]
```
